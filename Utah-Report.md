# General Information

The hike (probably) begins around `37.77604, -111.41964` at the Escalante River Trailhead, Near Escalante, UT, in the **Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument**. I say probably because the guides have only released our likely starting point and route area, to give a general idea, but are not saying yet the exact route specs.

# Expected Conditions

## Climate


- Average high and low temperatures, adjusted for elevation
- Precipitation amount
- Longevity, frequency, and intensity of storms
- Common weather patterns


Generally in the Escalante area, elevation 5820 ft, between April and May, you see highs around 66 and lows around 34. There is only about 1 inch of rainfall in April and May combined. As the humidity is low, we can expect shifts of +/- five degrees when gaining or losing elevation.

**Storms**

There is some slight chance of cold snap weather bringing in shivering rain or freezing snow.

"I've done numerous trips to this area mid April well into May. You will need to deal with this area as 2 seasons this time of year. Many days will be warm enough to go shorts and teeshirts. On the other hand we've also dealt with the occasional spring snow storm. These usually are just a day or 2 event, and may or may not, stick to the ground. Clothes wise you will need to have some layers including: a fleece, a waterproof shell, a stocking cap and gloves. And... hope you don't have to use them. If you're camping you can get both mild nights and an occasional night near freezing. I love this time of year for the nice cooler hiking temps. Rain has not really been an issue. The few snowstorms we've encountered have made for some interesting days. Just be prepared for some variable weather and you'll be fine. We will probably be camping late April/May this coming spring, around the Henry Mts, Capitol Reef and Escalante."

Spring weather (March through May) can be highly variable, with daytime high temperatures ranging from the 50s to the 70s and nighttime lows ranging from 20 to 50 degrees. Occasional cold fronts from the west and northwest can bring cold, windy conditions, rain showers in the lower elevations, and perhaps snow on the higher mesas, particularly in March and April. Generally warm, dry weather prevails between storm systems.

## Sun & moon cycles

- Hours between civil sunrise and civil sunset
- Dates of new and full moons, or the moon phase during the trip

There will be at least 14+ hours of sunlight + civil twilight to work with. Civil twilight will be about an hour.

The moon will be quite low, in a late waning to early waxing phase. Good for stargazing??

## Footing

- Description of the most common walking surface(s)
- Composition (dirt, rock bits, sand, slickrock, granite slabs, talus) and characteristics (dry, wet, dusty, muddy, slick or sticky)
- Coverage and composition of snowpack, and daily and weekly changes to it

"**Fine-grained blow sand** is a hallmark of trips on the Colorado Plateau (e.g. Grand Canyon, Moab, Escalante). Its significance is most acute when off-trail; on established trails, the sand becomes somewhat compacted by the traffic."

"**Periodic water crossings and wading** is the final consideration, with the frequency and depth depending on the route, time of year, and recent weather events. In Escalante, our groups are **in water on most days**, ranging from ankle-deep creeks that can almost be hopped across to full-on swims in deep canyons"

**Grand Staircase considerations**: Mix of slickrock, sandy terrain, and steep elevation changes. Slickrock is a term for smooth, wind-polished rock, or a rock formation that's slippery.

### Vegetation
- Prevalence of shade and thermal cover
- For off-trail routes: thickness, entanglement
- Existence of unfriendly types, like thorns and poison ivy
- Availability and suitability of fuel for open fires
![image.png](attachment:6574a468-24e1-44a7-b9f3-372afe5763f8.png) source: https://www.unps.org/segolily/Sego2021Fall.pdf

Along the Escalante River and its tributaries, you'll find riparian woodlands and shrublands dominated by Fremont cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, coyote willow, box elder, and water birch, with a rich understory of herbaceous plants. 


Here's a more detailed look at the common plants:


Trees and Shrubs:


Fremont Cottonwood (Populus fremontii): A large, deciduous tree that thrives in moist areas. 
Narrowleaf Cottonwood (Populus angustifolia): Another type of cottonwood, also common in riparian areas. 
Coyote Willow (Salix exigua): A shrubby willow species that grows along riverbanks. 
Box Elder (Acer negundo): A tree with maple-like leaves, often found in moist areas. 
Water Birch (Betula occidentalis): A birch species that tolerates wet conditions. 
Russian Olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia): A non-native invasive species that can outcompete native vegetation. 
Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.): Another invasive species that can form dense stands along riverbanks. 


Understory Plants:


Herbaceous Plants: A diverse array of grasses, wildflowers, and other plants that grow in the understory of riparian woodlands and shrublands. 
Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.): A common shrub found in drier areas. 
Rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.): Another shrub species, often found in open areas. 
Bitterbrush (Purshia spp.): A shrub with small, bitter-tasting leaves. 
Blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosa): A shrub with dark, leathery leaves. 
Yucca (Yucca spp.): A plant with long, sword-like leaves


**Shade** For much of the river portions of the hike, shade should be available most of the time. In higher terrain of off-trail routes, shade will be far less available unless encountering juniper and pine bunches.


**For off-trail routes: thickness, entanglement** Rocky sandstone slopes and tablelands tend to be
dominated by pygmy woodlands of **two-needle pinyon**
and **Utah juniper**. **Pinyon-juniper** woods cover over
770,000 acres of GSENM, making it the monumentâ€™s
most widespread vegetation type.  Low elevation upland sites on
fine-textured clay or sandy soils with annual
precipitation less than 7 inches are vegetated by **dry
desert shrub** and grasslands dominated by members of
the goosefoot family (Chenopodiaceae). Desert shrub
stands are especially well-developed along the lower
slopes and mesas of the Kaiparowits Plateau. **Shadscale**
tends to be the most prevalent species in shrub stands
on well-drained alkaline clay sites, while **mat saltbush**
predominates on clay barrens of the Tropic Shale near
the Paria River. Forests of **ponderosa pine** and **Douglas-fir** prevail on the
highest mesa tops or in deep, shady canyons of the
monument

**harmful plants** There is some poison ivy. ![image.png](attachment:ae643a1f-c0dc-4a2c-8c0c-72c709a44ba2.png) **Leaves of three, leave it be!**![image.png](attachment:c69f69a8-20e8-436e-9f92-589db334d8be.png) Otherwise, there are some plants such as Foothill DeathCamus, Water Hemlocks, Milkweeds that can cause death or severe sickness. But basically just don't eat random plants and you're fine LOL.


**fuel for fiers** in the more densly vegitated areas there should be plenty of fuel. **Note** that you cannot have open fires in river drainages of the Escalante River and all of its tributaries. (A river drainage, also known as a drainage basin or watershed, is an area of land where all the precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) drains into a specific stream or river, ultimately flowing to a common outlet like a lake, bay, or ocean).

## Remoteness
- Distance and time to the closest trafficked road and the closest town with services
- Natural barriers to self-rescue, e.g. canyons, thick brush, big rivers
- Reliability of cell reception


It's remote! The biggest towns nearby are Boulder and Escalante, linked to themselves and the trailhead by UT-12 highway. Canyons probably pose the toughest natural barrier, wiht slot canyons abounding in the area.

#### Great Cell Coverage

AT&T has the most:

| AT&T has the most | T-Mobile also good | Verizon a bit spotty | US Cellular has none |

**falling rock hazard**  "The major thing you have to be careful about in my opinion are falling rocks. It will snow one day, melt a little the next day, and water will seep into the cracks of rock walls. Then it will freeze at night and weaken the structure, falling with the slightest breeze. You wouldn't want to be winter camping where you took this picture or close to any rock wall. On multiple occasions, I've almost been crushed by rocks in slot canyons, and I've seen boulders the sizes of houses appear where they weren't previously" - Redditor, [Viojezajanu
